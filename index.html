                        Howdy! You've stumbled upon my personal portfolio page. Sadly, we weren't 
                        expecting visitors so soon. You can come back later, and 
                        hopefully when you do, I'll have something really impressive to show you. 
                        Need some suggestions on where to go? Try my <a href="https://drunkfurball.github.io/poker/" target="_blank">very addicting, super simple

                        You're still here? Well, this is awkward. How about I tell you a bit about 
                        myself? Yeah?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a single dad, currently working as a telemarketer--FREE PIZZA!!! Sorry, 
                        thought I was losing you. Yes, I'm one of those annoying folks that calls you 
                        during dinner and trys to convince you that you need to change your electric 
                        supplier or whatever. But I don't enjoy it. So I'm taking the advice of my 
                        computer science teacher, and pursuing a career in code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I began my interest in programming in the seventh grade, when I took the only 
                        coding course my high school, a public school in rural Minnesota with a 
                        graduating class of 80, had to offer. Honestly, I'm just glad they offered 
                        something.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I guess I showed a real knack for this stuff, because I completed, and aced 
                        that coding course in a few weeks (the course was designed to be a semester 
                        long).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I looked into the opportunities that computer science offered, but at the 
                        time of my graduation, I decided I wanted to do something different. I found 
                        it a little unsettling that my guidance counceller was pitching CS career 
                        paths to everyone in my class, all 80 of them, and at the time, the internet 
                        still screamed like a cat in a lawn mower when you logged on. [To be continued...]
