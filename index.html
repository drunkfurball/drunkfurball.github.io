                        Howdy!  Thanks for stopping by. I'm Murph Strange, and I make websites. I won't bore you with the typical laundry list of acronyms (if you need the list, visit my LinkdIn profile, my credentials are available there). I'm pretty good, and I am always getting better. I started coding in high school, helping to build my school's first website. By the time I left my home town, I had also work in a web development capacity for the local newspaper, a local band, and a few local businesses.

                        Until recently, I've mostly held regular jobs in various fields of industry. Beyond a few shops in my hometown, there wasn't a need for my little hobby (remember, this was a much different time), and I didn't think a young college me could handle the level of discipline freelancing requires. I'm a family man now. And a much older me knows the only way I will get to do what I truly love is to be my own boss.

                    <h3>What Can I Do For You?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every small business needs a web presence these days, cliche as it sounds, even freelance web guys like me. This is mine. Nice, right?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I can make you one, custom tailored to your small business's unique needs. Whether you just need a single page with your hours of operation and a phone number, that looks as good on desktop computer as it does on a mobile phone, or maybe you're thinking about full online shopping experience to reach a broader customer base. Whatever your situation, I can help.
