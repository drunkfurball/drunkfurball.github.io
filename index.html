                    <p>
                        Howdy! You've stumbled upon my personal portfolio page. Sadly, we weren't 
                        expecting visitors so soon. You can come back later, and 
                        hopefully when you do, I'll have something really impressive to show you. 
                        Need some suggestions on where to go? Try my <a href="https://drunkfurball.github.io/poker/" target="_blank">very addicting, super simple 
                        video poker game</a>.

                        You're still here? Well, this is awkward. How about I tell you a bit about 
                        myself? Yeah?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a single dad, currently working as a telemarketer--FREE PIZZA!!! Sorry, 
                        thought I was losing you. Yes, I'm one of those annoying folks that calls you 
                        during dinner and tries to convince you that you need to change your electric 
                        supplier or whatever. But I don't enjoy it. So I'm taking the advice my 
                        computer science teacher gave me almost two decades ago, and pursuing a career 
                        in code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've had an interest in computers since my parents bought our first home 
                        computer when I was eight. It had Windows 3.1, one of those floppy drives 
                        with the wide flat diskettes, and not much else. I learned DOS commands on 
                        it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm well versed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which has been a hobby of 
                        mine since the 6th grade. I also know Python, and have spent a bit of time 
                        in Java and the C languages.  I worked as a web content manager for my 
                        small town newspaper and webmaster for my highschool before going off to 
                        college (to pursue psychology, trucking, nursing, and spent a short while 
                        as a photographer, and a lot of time in retail).

                        Through the years, I've done well to keep my skills current. I'm a participant
