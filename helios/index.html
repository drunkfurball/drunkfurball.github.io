                    Hi! I don't know how you found me, but here you are. So, where is here? Here is my silly little project to satisfy my own curiosity, and explore further some often reported, allegedly unexplainable mysteries. It is my hope that by casting a light at a sideways angle, new clues may emerge, allowing us to lay some of these stories to rest.

                    And who am I? I am the great and powerful Murph, Wizard, Webmaster, and Wanderer in the dark. I'm a web programmer with an appetite for strange and unusual tales. I have spent much of my life reading stories of ghosts, cryptids, aliens, episodes of psychic phenomenon, and creepy coincidences. I am also an amateur ghost hunter, and can be found in dark abandoned buildings asking things that probably don't exist to come out and play. It's a pleasure to make your aquaintence. I shall be your guide as we delve into the unexplained. I'll hold the ruler as we connect the dots between the world we can see, and the world that may exist beyond our senses.

                    Where can you expect this ride into the darkness to take you? Unknown. I have a lot of ideas, and I'm hoping to tackle most of them. I want to revisit West Virginia during the height of the Mothman sightings, when men in black and strange phone calls in the dead of night are only the tip of the iceberg. I want to take you back to that book depository in Dallas and look down the scope of Lee Harvey Oswald's rifle, and show you the final moments of John F. Kennedy. I want to dive with you to the bottom of Loch Ness, and journey into the heart of Oregon's forest country in search of creatures science tells us should not exists. And we may look skyward and flag down a Martian flagship, and hitch a ride to Planet X hiding at the edge of our solar system.

                    Your price for admission into this house of horrors, your ticket to ride this crazy train, your fee for the late return of this haunted video to the mysterious neighborhood Blockbuster Video that you could have sworn closed years ago... nothing. Yup. I'm doing this for free. This is a labor of love, done entirely in my free time, and all my meals are paid from my own pocket. I'm not even asking for donations. If you want to contribute in some way, you can send a tip to the tip line, once I set one up. Meanwhile, I ask only that you keep an open mind, but not so open your brain falls out. Take everything you see and hear with a grain of salt, and keep in mind the distance a story travels is relative to the outlandishness of the story. Look for the loose threads, unravel the tapestry of the often overtold but somehow unsolved stories. Together, we'll see how far down this rabbit hole really goes.
