                <p>
                    Hi! I don't know how you found me, but here you are. So, where is here? Here is my silly little project to satisfy my own curiosity, and explore further some often reported, allegedly unexplainable mysteries. It is my hope that by casting a light at a sideways angle, new clues may emerge, allowing us to lay some of these stories to rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And who am I? I am the great and powerful Murph, Wizard, Webmaster, and Wanderer in the dark. I'm a web programmer with an appetite for strange and unusual tales. I have spent much of my life reading stories of ghosts, cryptids, aliens, episodes of psychic phenomenon, and creepy coincidences. I am also an amateur ghost hunter, and can be found in dark abandoned buildings asking things that probably don't exist to come out and play. It's a pleasure to make your aquaintence. I shall be your guide as we delve into the unexplained. I'll hold the ruler as we connect the dots between the world we can see, and the world that may exist beyond our senses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where can you expect this ride into the darkness to take you? Unknown. I have a lot of ideas, and I'm hoping to tackle most of them. I want to revisit West Virginia during the height of the Mothman sightings, when men in black and strange phone calls in the dead of night are only the tip of the iceberg. I want to take you back to that book depository in Dallas and look down the scope of Lee Harvey Oswald's rifle, and show you the final moments of John F. Kennedy. I want to dive with you to the bottom of Loch Ness, and journey into the heart of Oregon's forest country in search of creatures science tells us should not exists. And we may look skyward and flag down a Martian flagship, and hitch a ride to Planet X hiding at the edge of our solar system.

                <p>
                    Your price for admission into this house of horrors, your ticket to ride this crazy train, your fee for the late return of this haunted video to the mysterious neighborhood Blockbuster Video that you could have sworn closed years ago... nothing. Yup. I'm doing this for free. This is a labor of love, done entirely in my free time, and all my meals are paid from my own pocket. I'm not even asking for donations. If you want to contribute in some way, you can send a tip to the tip line, once I set one up. Meanwhile, I ask only that you keep an open mind, but not so open your brain falls out. Take everything you see and hear with a grain of salt, and keep in mind the distance a story travels is relative to the outlandishness of the story. Look for the loose threads, unravel the tapestry of the often overtold but somehow unsolved stories. Together, we'll see how far down this rabbit hole really goes.

                <h5>Whys and Hows</h5>
                <h6>Murph Strange - 8/6/2017</h6>
                <p>
                    You're back!? Wow. This is kinda awkward. You see, I still haven't gotten the hang of this reporting regularly, thing. I was thinking, I'd pick a couple of strange cases from the history books, research a bit, gather the clues in a pile, set fire to the myths and legends that often surround them, and lay bare the truth, unadulterated and fair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Except my life is a bit hectic. I'm a single dad, raising a handful of a young man that demands lots of attention. Since I can't drag an eleven year old into the dark looking for monsters, I can only go looking for trouble when he's not making any. Even with all that, I still feel the need to seek the unknown and drag it, kicking and screaming, into the light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Forgive me if the updates aren't frequent, if months pass and there are no updates. Everything's fine. The government hasn't locked me in a secret black site, nobody's waterboarding me; I may not be the most upstanding citizen, but the government can rarely settle on what it's own story is to waste time with an old hermit writing his own. I'm one guy, shouting into the wind, and the Universe doesn't care about me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So to recap, I'm slow, and busy, but I still see this as a labor of love. When I can, I'll bring you stories, some you may have heard around the campfire, all allegedly true. With these stories I'll also present the little scraps of truth that get forgotten. It is usually those small facts that get overlooked, but surprisingly, leaving them out changes the whole tale from mundane to mysterious. For example, take the curious case of David Lang.
                </p>
                <p>
                    David Lang was a farmer, family man, and mysterious phenomenon all in one. See, Mr. Lang vanished, in full view of his wife, children, local judge, and a neighbor, while crossing his field, in broad daylight. Sounds amazing, right? I'll revisit this story at a later date with all the details. For now, the short story is that it never happened. Any of it. Somehow, it got circulated as fact, and made it's way into several publications. It's a great example of how these things happen; everyone's wondering how a man could have vanished, in full view of so many witnesses, nobody asks the obvious. Did any of them actually exist? It's also a great example of how one tiny detail changes the entire narrative. Somewhere along the line, a fictional tale got filed away as fact, and that's how this particular ghost story was born.

                <h4>Defending Flat Earthers</h4>
                <h5>Your right to be wrong in the privacy of your own bubble</h5>
                <h6>Murph Strange - 9/1/2017</h6>
                <p>
                    I never thought I'd find myself in the unlikely position of sticking up for someone that believes the Earth is flat. But this morning, I woke up to a post that made me mad. A fellow member of a coder forum on a popular social media site outed another member for believing in the flat earth theory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look. I don't believe in things that aren't established fact if I can help it, and have spent a great deal of time debunking and calling out flat-earthers. Their theory is so far beyond the realm of possibility it's ludacrious. Every field of science would need to be wrong. Things we depend on daily, like satellites, would not exists. And the amount of money needed to maintain this big of a secret doesn't exist, and the number of people needed to keep this secret assures me that it would not be kept secret for long. I have yet to see a conclusive argument for the flat earth theory that can't be disproven. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But you have every right to be wrong about something. Humans aren't born knowing everything, and the things we don't have nailed down are acceptable to be speculated on. And if you choose to take up an argument that's been thoroughly debunked, that's on you. I won't take issue with your belief structure until you're in my face over it, or trying to push your agenda somewhere where it will impact my daily life, or someplace where its discussion just doesn't belong. If you and your buddies are hanging out in your basement, waxing philosophical about what it might be like to live on a planet that rests on the back of a giant turtle, I will not be kicking down your door to correct you. If you show up at my kid's school demanding that your bullshit theory gets equal class time, I'll make sure you leave with a boot in your rear. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    What isn't cool, in my opinion, is seeking out those who believe something you don't, and dragging them into a fight they didn't ask for. First, it makes you look like a real jerk when you attack someone like that, and nobody wants to waste time listening to a jerk. Second, nobody on that forum was concerned about flat earthers, and while it may have appeared humorous to some, it was an unnecessary distraction for everyone else. And it brought the flat-earther's message to more people, without any effort on the part of the flat-earther. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Believing in something like the flat earth theory, while completely ridiculous, is your right. As long as you aren't pushing that stupidity on others, believe whatever you need to to get through your day. Lots of folks do it. They call it religion, and apparently there are entire buildings, several in your area probably, where others who think the same can gather to congradulate each other on believing in the same weirdly unsupported ideas. I'm not going to knock you for choosing religion. It gives you a sense of community, as any good conspiracy theory should. See, conspiracy, or better, it's root conspire, requires multiple people to participate. Conspiracy theories do exactly the same. You share them, and ask folks to question their preconcieved notions along with you. That's why they are so much fun for some, and so annoying for others. If you stay in your lane and don't push your brand of crazy where it doesn't belong, or insist it's equally valid and deserves the same consideration as proven scientific concepts, you deserve the freedom to explore whatever crazy ideas you like in peace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As skeptics, the rest of us are charged with the task of defending rationality. We don't need to seek out conspiracy theory believers like vampires, dragging them from their darkened basements into the sun to burst into flame in front of the whole village. Our duty is to educate those who are willing to listen to reason, and defend science and facts as the dependable interpretations of the physical world around us when necessary. That's not accomplished by shaming someone's secretly held suspicions on public forums that have nothing to do with those ideas. Decrying flat earth theory on a coding forum puts you in exactly the same category as the guy wearing a tinfoil hat you're trying to expose, a disturbance and a distraction. We need to stay in our lane as much as they do. People have a right to be stupid and ignorant of established scientific fact. The ones we need to be concerned with are the ones pushing the false information to the same realm of discussion as real issues, making it harder for people seeking real answers and knowledge. Those guys are fair game. And they aren't hard to find. The creationist pushing for biblical ideaologies be given equal time in our classrooms as evolution, a well established and well supported scientific idea that species change over time to adapt to their changing environments, and may become a completely new species over generations of breeding useful traits in and unhelpful ones out;
