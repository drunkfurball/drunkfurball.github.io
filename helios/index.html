                <p>
                    Hi! I don't know how you found me, but here you are. So, where is here? Here is my silly little project to satisfy my own curiosity, and explore further some often reported, allegedly unexplainable mysteries. It is my hope that by casting a light at a sideways angle, new clues may emerge, allowing us to lay some of these stories to rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And who am I? I am the great and powerful Murph, Wizard, Webmaster, and Wanderer in the dark. I'm a web programmer with an appetite for strange and unusual tales. I have spent much of my life reading stories of ghosts, cryptids, aliens, episodes of psychic phenomenon, and creepy coincidences. I am also an amateur ghost hunter, and can be found in dark abandoned buildings asking things that probably don't exist to come out and play. It's a pleasure to make your aquaintence. I shall be your guide as we delve into the unexplained. I'll hold the ruler as we connect the dots between the world we can see, and the world that may exist beyond our senses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where can you expect this ride into the darkness to take you? Unknown. I have a lot of ideas, and I'm hoping to tackle most of them. I want to revisit West Virginia during the height of the Mothman sightings, when men in black and strange phone calls in the dead of night are only the tip of the iceberg. I want to take you back to that book depository in Dallas and look down the scope of Lee Harvey Oswald's rifle, and show you the final moments of John F. Kennedy. I want to dive with you to the bottom of Loch Ness, and journey into the heart of Oregon's forest country in search of creatures science tells us should not exists. And we may look skyward and flag down a Martian flagship, and hitch a ride to Planet X hiding at the edge of our solar system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your price for admission into this house of horrors, your ticket to ride this crazy train, your fee for the late return of this haunted video to the mysterious neighborhood Blockbuster Video that you could have sworn closed years ago... nothing. Yup. I'm doing this for free. This is a labor of love, done entirely in my free time, and all my meals are paid from my own pocket. I'm not even asking for donations. If you want to contribute in some way, you can send a tip to the tip line, once I set one up. Meanwhile, I ask only that you keep an open mind, but not so open your brain falls out. Take everything you see and hear with a grain of salt, and keep in mind the distance a story travels is relative to the outlandishness of the story. Look for the loose threads, unravel the tapestry of the often overtold but somehow unsolved stories. Together, we'll see how far down this rabbit hole really goes.

                <h5>Whys and Hows</h5>
                <h6>Murph Strange - 8/6/2017</h6>
                <p>
                    You're back!? Wow. This is kinda awkward. You see, I still haven't gotten the hang of this reporting regularly, thing. I was thinking, I'd pick a couple of strange cases from the history books, research a bit, gather the clues in a pile, set fire to the myths and legends that often surround them, and lay bare the truth, unadulterated and fair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Except my life is a bit hectic. I'm a single dad, raising a handful of a young man that demands lots of attention. Since I can't drag an eleven year old into the dark looking for monsters, I can only go looking for trouble when he's not making any. Even with all that, I still feel the need to seek the unknown and drag it, kicking and screaming, into the light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Forgive me if the updates aren't frequent, if months pass and there are no updates. Everything's fine. The government hasn't locked me in a secret black site, nobody's waterboarding me; I may not be the most upstanding citizen, but the government can rarely settle on what it's own story is to waste time with an old hermit writing his own. I'm one guy, shouting into the wind, and the Universe doesn't care about me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So to recap, I'm slow, and busy, but I still see this as a labor of love. When I can, I'll bring you stories, some you may have heard around the campfire, all allegedly true. With these stories I'll also present the little scraps of truth that get forgotten. It is usually those small facts that get overlooked, but surprisingly, leaving them out changes the whole tale from mundane to mysterious. For example, take the curious case of David Lang.
                </p>
                <p>
                    David Lang was a farmer, family man, and mysterious phenomenon all in one. See, Mr. Lang vanished, in full view of his wife, children, local judge, and a neighbor, while crossing his field, in broad daylight. Sounds amazing, right? I'll revisit this story at a later date with all the details. For now, the short story is that it never happened. Any of it. Somehow, it got circulated as fact, and made it's way into several publications. It's a great example of how these things happen; everyone's wondering how a man could have vanished, in full view of so many witnesses, nobody asks the obvious. Did any of them actually exist? It's also a great example of how one tiny detail changes the entire narrative. Somewhere along the line, a fictional tale got filed away as fact, and that's how this particular ghost story was born.

                <h4>Defending Flat Earthers - Opinion</h4>
                <h5>Your right to be wrong in the privacy of your own bubble</h5>
                <h6>Murph Strange - 9/1/2017</h6>
                <p>
                    I never thought I'd find myself in the unlikely position of sticking up for someone that believes the Earth is flat. But this morning, I woke up to a post that made me mad. A fellow member of a coder forum on a popular social media site outed another member for believing in the flat earth theory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look. I don't believe in things that aren't established fact if I can help it, and have spent a great deal of time debunking and calling out flat-earthers. Their theory is so far beyond the realm of possibility it's ludacrious. Every field of science would need to be wrong. Things we depend on daily, like satellites, would not exists. And the amount of money needed to maintain this big of a secret doesn't exist, and the number of people needed to keep this secret assures me that it would not be kept secret for long. I have yet to see a conclusive argument for the flat earth theory that can't be disproven. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But you have every right to be wrong about something. Humans aren't born knowing everything, and the things we don't have nailed down are acceptable to be speculated on. And if you choose to take up an argument that's been thoroughly debunked, that's on you. I won't take issue with your belief structure until you're in my face over it, or trying to push your agenda somewhere where it will impact my daily life, or someplace where its discussion just doesn't belong. If you and your buddies are hanging out in your basement, waxing philosophical about what it might be like to live on a planet that rests on the back of a giant turtle, I will not be kicking down your door to correct you. If you show up at my kid's school demanding that your bullshit theory gets equal class time, I'll make sure you leave with a boot in your rear. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    What isn't cool, in my opinion, is seeking out those who believe something you don't, and dragging them into a fight they didn't ask for. First, it makes you look like a real jerk when you attack someone like that, and nobody wants to waste time listening to a jerk. Second, nobody on that forum was concerned about flat earthers, and while it may have appeared humorous to some, it was a distraction for everyone else. And it brought the flat-earther's message to more people, without any effort on the part of the flat-earther.

                <h5>Reckless predictions and the passage of time</h5>
                <h6>Murph Strange - 9/28/2017</h6>
                <p>
                    I had a feeling that this was the year we would lose Hugh Hefner, and it is with a heavy heart that I mourn his passing this morning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let me state here and now that if I'm psychic, I don't know it. But I'm about to make a couple of predictions. This is in response to the latest doomsday prediction that fell flat (as they always do). According to a Christian Numerologist, or some equally strange pseudo-scientist, Saturday, September 23rd was the Rapture. To the uninitiated, first, kudos on not buying into this crazy, and second, the Rapture is a biblical end times event folks have been predicting for awhile. Thousands of years, at least. You'd think that with a track record of never being right once in a thousand years would convince these folks that the end of the world is not going to be revealed to you by mixing quack methodology and archaic manuscripts. You are literally blending nonsense with the writings of folks who had access to less information than you carry in your pocket on a regular basis. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Too harsh? Maybe, but it's accurate. You can look up NASA and see that there isn't a meteor heading towards Earth, according to the satellites they've flung out into space. You can look up NOAA and the National Weather Service and see if there are any superstorms set to wipe us out. You can contact Yellowstone and ask all kinds of questions about the super volcano. You, human with access to this site and therefore the internet, have greater access to knowledge than any other person in history. You might not be smarter than they were, or care to read the entire known collective knowledge of rocks, but you could, more easily than they ever could. Nostradamus didn't use Chrome. He had access to the books available to him, limited to what was written at that time, and geographically feasibly accessible. In his day, if the ancient Mayan civilization had been discovered, he would have needed to charter a ship to sail across the ocean without the aid of the coast guard, or modern conveniences like GPS and radios, or packaged foods and modern medicine just to hear about it from the guy making the discovery. The trip would have stood a very good chance of murdering him and his entire crew. Today, you 'google' Mayans and boom. Pictures, text written by experts in the field, and peer reviewed theories, delivered to you, on the crapper. Nostradamus didn't even have indoor plumbing. So, I ask you, do you really think he knew something back then that we don't know know now?
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, stop buying into these crazy televangelists and their completely unfounded predictions. Instead, here's mine! XD
                </p>
                <p>
                    In October sometime, the JFK Assassination files are due to be released to the public. We may finally know if there really was a second gunman on the grassy knoll. There wasn't. That's my prediction. There was a second gunman, but Oswald worked alone. The second gunman was actually a Secret Service agent who accidently fired his weapon, the bullet catching JFK in the head, killing him. It was an accident. Oswald shot Kennedy in the spine, and though that shot wasn't lethal, it would have turned Kennedy into a vegetable, and the bullet that went through his head was actually from a Secret Service Agent who discharged his weapon in the scramble following Oswald's shots. A cover-up does exist, but it wasn't of some grand scheme with the Illuminati and the Mafia, or CIA, or Russia. It was to conceal from the American people that on a day when things weren't going right, one guy accidently ended the life of a great leader. The public would not have easily forgiven such a thing, and honestly it just muddies the waters for the media. JFK was killed by his own guard. That's my prediction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Defending this prediction, I heard a story from a writer on strange events throughout history, he had done a bit of research on the JFK assassination, and found out the expert that proved Oswald could have made three shots with his rifle in the time alotted had a few other things to say on the incident. He weighed in on the bullet fragments, and the 'magic-bullet' path that seems to have caused so much confusion. It all tracks too. The inconsistencies and the parts of the story that really get weird actually make sense if you consider a what-if scenario where some hapless secret service agent, fresh on the job, accidently shoots the guy he's supposed to protect while under fire from a shooter firing from un upstairs window. Johnson even commented a few times that Secret Service made him nervous, that he would be accidently executed by one of his own agents. Hmmmm... Kennedy's brain disappearing so that the pieces of the puzzle that point the finger at the poor Secret Service Agent are secretly spirited away by his superiors so as to prevent his career from going belly up. You can't undo what happened, but you can mitigate the fall out. Oswald intended to kill JFK, and for all intentions that matter in reality he succeeded, no need to cloudy things with "Well, actually, he would have been a vegetable if not for that one Secret Service guy." And the poor dude has to live his whole life knowing that he killed JFK, and he can't tell anyone. Could you imagine? So, the weapons expert's theory is fairly mundane compared to the conspiracy theories that have sinister actors from all the dark corners that we like to see them crawl out from, indicating to me that it's probably the most likely explanation. The world's not usually not that creative.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My second prediction, current President Angry Orange doesn't get re-elected in 2020. In less than a year, he has done all the things he condemned his opponents in the election campaign for doing, sympathized with white supremacists, condemned peaceful civil rights protesters, and in an address to the UN stated he would have to destroy another nation. Also there's a lot of people in his administration that get awfully forgetful about meetings where a lot of Russians were present. And stating you have no Russian ties when anyone can find photos of Russians you've done business with posing with you at events in honor of business deeals you've done with those Russian fellas, and you sing the praise the Russian government like some sports hero and foreign intelligence agencies report that reliable sources tell them Russia has blackmail material on you, and you're firing anyone that investigates the matter, you're probably guilty. At the very least, you're not helping. At the time of this article, we know collusion was attempted, and somehow the administration defends this as okay because they weren't good at it, meanwhile investigations into voter fruad have only turned up possible breaches by the voter system by Russians, and that many of the administration registered to vote in two districts.
